**Title:**
Generating Personalized PDFs with JavaScript (jsPDF)

**Body:**

Hello everyone,

I recently developed a feature that allows users to generate personalized PDF documents directly from an HTML form using the jsPDF library in JavaScript.

Here's how it works:
1. The user fills out a form containing details such as project names, authors, and other relevant information.
2. Upon clicking a "Gerar PDF" button, the page initializes a new instance of `jspdf`.
3. It retrieves values from input fields using DOM methods like `getElementById`.
4. The PDF is configured with basic settings including layout and orientation.
5. Simple text content is added to the document using the `text()` method.
6. Finally, the generated PDF file is saved as "informacoes.pdf" in a user-friendly directory.

This feature provides users with an easy way to share their project details or personal information securely. The use of jsPDF enables simple and effective integration into web applications without relying on external plugins.

If you're interested in implementing something similar in your projects, I'd be happy to provide more detailed code examples and answer any questions.
