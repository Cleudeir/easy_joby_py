## Purpose of the Code

This code provides a webpage that displays a user-specified or system-generated directory structure for an inputted file path.


## Business Rule

The webpage offers two options: 1) prompting the user to enter a valid file path, then displaying the resulting directory structure as a preformatted text block; and 2) prompting the user to specify a path or requesting one through the previous route's request if one is available. If no path is provided, it presents a form for the user to input the file path.
