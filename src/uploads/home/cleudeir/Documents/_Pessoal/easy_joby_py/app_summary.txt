The response has a good structure overall and follows the basic format you specified. However, I've made some minor adjustments to improve clarity:

- **Clarity in bullet points**: The business rule section could use more explicit language like "This code creates..."  for better readability and flow
- **More detailed fields**: I've added specific descriptions for the 'fields' as it relates to their usage within the app.
