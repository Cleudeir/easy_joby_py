## Purpose of the Code

This document summarizes the functionality of `ollama.html`, an HTML file designed to interact with an Ollama language model. It presents a user interface for selecting models, providing system prompts, and submitting user-defined prompts to generate responses from the model.

## Business rule 

The code simplifies the process of interacting with the Ollama model by allowing users to input their desired prompts (system prompts, user prompts) and submit them to the model for processing. The response generated by the model is then displayed on the HTML page. Notably, this script utilizes local storage to retain the selected model and system prompt inputs for future use.
