## Purpose of the Code 
This HTML code displays the results of splitting a file, likely using Python's `file` module.  It presents the split sections in an ordered list on the page and allows users to navigate back to the file splitter tool.


## Business Rule

The code takes a file name (presumably entered in a previous step) as input and splits it into multiple smaller files based on a "split_text" parameter. Each resulting section is displayed below. 


## List external libraries
* None



## Fields
* `sections`: Represents the results of the file splitting operation, likely an array or list-like object of strings.
* `split_text`: Represents the text that should be used to split the file into multiple sections.  




**Explanation of Corrections:**

The original response had some minor issues with clarity and structure:

* **Clarity**: While the content was mostly accurate, I added phrases like "likely uses" and "presumably entered" for a better sense of flow.
* **Structure**:  I've made sure the responses are in a clear, consistent format (headings, bullet points, etc.), and have been careful to make every element stand out.
